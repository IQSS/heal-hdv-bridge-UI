      "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT. More than 2,700 Illinois residents died of opiate overdose in 2017a number that surpassed the states. combined fatalities from road accidents and gun homicide. Individuals leaving jail and prison may be at highest. risk of fatal overdose and other drug-related harms. Severely vulnerable men and women face these risks at. precisely the moment they cross boundaries of fragmented criminal justice, social service, and public health. systems, and are thus most vulnerable to lost follow-up and disengagement from services, or to have other. basic needs left unattended. The challenge may be most acute for detainees who rapidly flow through jail. settings, where unpredictable departures hinder discharge planning and care coordination, and where justice. stakeholders may hold attitudes that stigmatize substance use or resistant to harm reduction interventions.. Individuals returning to Chicago communities of color are near relatively rich resources for both treatment and. harm reduction. Yet they must navigate epicenters of illicit narcotics distribution that feature particularly high. incidence of fatal overdose from heroin, fentanyl, and other synthetic opioids. Rural individuals in Southern. Illinois, may have long travel distances from any methadone facility or any DEA-waivered physician available to. prescribe buprenorphine. Rural patients also face geographic barriers to the provision of naloxone and SSPs.. Many harm reduction services have been designed and implemented to serve urban populations in traditional. centers of opioid use. The acceptability and cultural competence of such rural services remains understudied.. Our proposed multi-site ROMI trial (Reducing Opioid Mortality in Illinois) seeks to address this public health. challenge through improved supports and service linkages to medication-assisted treatment (MAT), naloxone. distribution, and syringe support services (SSPs) provided to justice-involved individuals living with opioid use. disorders. We seek to test whether a unified case management approach that includes peer recovery coaches. can improve treatment engagement and retention in five diverse urban and rural contexts that all experience. high rates of opioid disorders, overdose, and related harms.. We request funds to implement a five-site Randomized Controlled Trial, enrolling at least 1,000 individuals. living with OUD. The ROMI trial will be carried out using a hub-and-spoke model, with centralized long-. standing social services infrastructure at the Community Outreach Intervention Projects (COIP) hosted at the. University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). COIP provides case management/transition of care services to justice-. involved opioid users, extending resources and technical assistance to less-populated rural areas hardest-hit. by the opioid epidemic. Using a hybrid type-one effectiveness implementation design, we propose a simple but. effective package of treatment and harm reduction interventions to reduce subsequent opioid use and related. harms in diverse contexts. Our pragmatic trial is thus well-positioned to test effectiveness while collecting. contextual data for implementation.",

ROMI aims to understand and test strategies for linking individuals with a history of opioid use disorder who are released from Illinois jails and prisons to substance use treatment. ROMI is one of twelve grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as part of the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) to support research on quality addiction treatment for opioid use disorder in criminal justice settings nationwide.",
          "detailedDescription": "This NIDA-funded multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of an established, intensive case management model for study participants who are awaiting release from four jails and two prisons across Illinois. The investigators seek to demonstrate that a unified case management approach can improve treatment engagement and retention among individuals who face high risks of opioid use disorders, overdose, and related harms. The investigators will examine the impact of case management and peer recovery coaching on participants' engagement with treatment and harm reduction interventions. The investigators will also study secondary outcomes including insurance enrollment, re-arrest, use of mental health services, and more.\n\nROMI will enroll at least 300 individuals with opioid disorders in the CMPR group, and at least 300 participants in the naloxone-only across five geographically distinct sites of care. All participants will receive harm reduction resources. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment group will display declines in opioid use, re-arrest, self-reported syringe sharing, and overdose risk behaviors relative to the control groups. The investigators will also examine differences between urban - rural and rural differences in treatment engagement and retention engagement, retention, and downstream outcomes across treatment arms. Aside from demonstrating these treatment impacts, the investigators will guide, document and evaluate ROMI's implementation efforts to ensure consistency across sites across sites and to inform future replication of the model in different settings or for different populations. (Edited 11/27/23 to reflect changes in recruitment from 500 in each treatment arm to 300)"
