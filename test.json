The proposed project seeks to demonstrate improved MAT participation, naloxone distribution, and syringe support services (SSPs) among justice-involved persons with opioid use disorders, and thus improve health and criminal justice outcomes across diverse urban and rural settings in Illinois. Reducing Opioid Mortality in Illinois (ROMI) is a multi-site trial that will be carried out using a hub-and-spoke model, with centralized long-standing social services infrastructure at the Community Outreach Intervention Projects (COIP) hosted at the University of Illinois at Chicago. COIP provides case management/transition of care services to justice-involved opioid users, extending resources and technical assistance to less-populated rural areas hardest hit by the opioid epidemic.",

      "alternative_study_description": "This NIDA-funded multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of an established, intensive case management model for study participants who are awaiting release from four jails and two prisons across Illinois. The investigators seek to demonstrate that a unified case management approach can improve treatment engagement and retention among individuals who face high risks of opioid use disorders, overdose, and related harms. The investigators will examine the impact of case management and peer recovery coaching on participants' engagement with treatment and harm reduction interventions. The investigators will also study secondary outcomes including insurance enrollment, re-arrest, use of mental health services, and more.\n\nROMI will enroll at least 300 individuals with opioid disorders in the CMPR group, and at least 300 participants in the naloxone-only across five geographically distinct sites of care. All participants will receive harm reduction resources. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment group will display declines in opioid use, re-arrest, self-reported syringe sharing, and overdose risk behaviors relative to the control groups. The investigators will also examine differences between urban - rural and rural differences in treatment engagement and retention engagement, retention, and downstream outcomes across treatment arms. Aside from demonstrating these treatment impacts, the investigators will guide, document and evaluate ROMI's implementation efforts to ensure consistency across sites across sites and to inform future replication of the model in different settings or for different populations. (Edited 11/27/23 to reflect changes in recruitment from 500 in each treatment arm to 300)"
